# Top right number of each layer is (2x+1)^2
# Thus the sum of all numbers in a layer is 4*(2x+1)^2 -12x = 16x^2 + 4x +4
# The answer is 1 + (16x^2 + 4x +4 for x from 1 to 500)
# = 2001 + (16x^2 + 4x for x from 1 to 500)
# = 2001 + 501000 + (16x^2 for x from 1 to 500)
# = 2001 + 501000 + 668668000
# = 669171001
